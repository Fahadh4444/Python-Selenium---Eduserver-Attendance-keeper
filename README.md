# Python-Selenium---Eduserver-Attendance-keeper

Hi guys,  
This is Fahadh,  
Yeah I know now a days its becaming hard to mark attendance in eduserver, due to our neglegence or some other at home it misses sometimes in just seconds.  
To solve this issuse, this repo small code written in python using it's Selenium package.

### After downloading this repo all have to do some steps in order to run it properly

- Install selenium package in our pc
  - using command  
    <code><b>pip install selenium</b></code>
- Then you have to download web driver for chrome  
  Follow this link to [download it.](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/)  
  `NOTE: Download Chrome webdriver which supports your PC's Chrome brower.`
- After this unzip downloaded file, copy chromewebdriver.exe, paste some where in PC except in C drive and copy it's path(address).
- Now open our repo in code editor to make some changes in code

  - Change path to path where you pasted web driver and add "\chromedriver.exe" at the end if required.
  - Fill your username in place of username as shown in photo below.
  - Do it same for your password too.

### Now your code is ready to run, Open terminal or GIT Bash in repo and run [Kepper.py](Keeper.py) file.

This helps you atleast relax in between classes without hurriedly marking attendanceðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž
